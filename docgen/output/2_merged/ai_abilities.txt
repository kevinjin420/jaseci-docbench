## AI Abilities

### LLM Integration
-   **Streaming with ReAct Tool Calling**: Real-time streaming support for ReAct method when using tools. After tool execution, the LLM streams the final synthesized answer token-by-token.
-   **`by llm()` Feature Methods as Tools**: Supports adding methods of classes as tools for the LLM.
    ```jac
    obj = ToolHolder()
    response = by llm(tools=[obj.tool])
    ```
-   **LLM Function Overriding**: Override any regular function with an LLM-powered implementation at runtime.
    ```jac
    function_call() by llm()
    ```

### Semantic Strings
-   Attach natural language descriptions to code elements (functions, classes, parameters) for LLM-powered code generation and execution.
    ```jac
    str "This is a semantic description."
    ```
