# Observability and Logging

## Observability

### Logging

The `logging` module provides a flexible framework for emitting log messages.

#### Basic Configuration

```jac
import:py from logging {basicConfig, INFO, DEBUG, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL};

# Configure basic logging to console
basicConfig(level=INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s');
```

#### Log Levels

*   `DEBUG`: Detailed information, typically of interest only when diagnosing problems.
*   `INFO`: Confirmation that things are working as expected.
*   `WARNING`: An indication that something unexpected happened, or indicative of some problem in the near future (e.g., ‘disk space low’). The software is still working as expected.
*   `ERROR`: Due to a more serious problem, the software has not been able to perform some function.
*   `CRITICAL`: A serious error, indicating that the program itself may be unable to continue running.

#### Emitting Log Messages

```jac
import:py from logging {debug, info, warning, error, critical};

debug("This is a debug message.");
info("This is an info message.");
warning("This is a warning message.");
error("This is an error message.");
critical("This is a critical message.");
```

#### Advanced Configuration (File Logging)

```jac
import:py from logging {basicConfig, INFO};

# Configure logging to a file
basicConfig(filename='app.log', filemode='a', level=INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s');
```

### Assertions

The `assert` statement is used for debugging purposes to check if a condition is true. If the condition is false, an `AssertionError` is raised.

```jac
assert condition, "Optional error message"
```

**Example:**

```jac
can_proceed = True;
assert can_proceed, "Cannot proceed due to an invalid state."

value = 10;
assert value > 0, "Value must be positive."
```
