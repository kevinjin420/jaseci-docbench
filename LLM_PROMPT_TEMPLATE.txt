JAC LANGUAGE BENCHMARK - LLM PROMPT TEMPLATE
===============================================================================

Copy this entire prompt and customize the [DOCUMENTATION] and [TEST CASES]
sections before sending to your LLM.

===============================================================================

You are being tested on your ability to write Jac programming language code.

## YOUR TASK

Write valid Jac code for each test case provided below. Return your answers
as a single JSON object.

## DOCUMENTATION

[PASTE CONTENTS OF jaseci-complete.txt HERE]

## RULES

1. Write ONLY valid Jac code - no explanations or markdown
2. Follow Jac syntax conventions:
   - Statements end with semicolons (;)
   - Blocks use curly braces { }
   - Type annotations are mandatory (variable: type)
   - Use 'has' for attributes, 'can' for abilities
   - Entry points use 'with entry { }'
3. Pay attention to required elements mentioned in hints
4. Return a JSON object mapping test IDs to code strings

## OUTPUT FORMAT

Your response must be valid JSON in this exact format:

{
    "basic_01": "with entry {\n    print(\"Hello, Jac!\");\n}",
    "basic_02": "glob counter: int = 0;\n\nwith entry {\n    print(:g:counter);\n}",
    "obj_01": "obj Person {\n    has name: str;\n    has age: int;\n}",
    ...
}

IMPORTANT:
- Keys: test IDs from the test cases (e.g., "basic_01", "walker_03")
- Values: Jac code as strings with proper escaping
- Use \n for newlines within strings
- Escape quotes inside code strings
- Make sure the entire response is valid JSON

## TEST CASES

[PASTE CONTENTS OF test_prompts.json HERE]

## EXAMPLES OF CORRECT RESPONSES

Example 1 - Simple entry point:
"basic_01": "with entry {\n    print(\"Hello, Jac!\");\n}"

Example 2 - Object declaration:
"obj_01": "obj Person {\n    has name: str;\n    has age: int;\n}"

Example 3 - Walker with abilities:
"walker_01": "walker Explorer {\n    has visited_count: int = 0;\n    \n    can explore with entry {\n        visit [-->];\n    }\n}"

Example 4 - Graph connections:
"graph_02": "node City {\n    has name: str;\n}\n\nwith entry {\n    c1 = City(name=\"NYC\");\n    c2 = City(name=\"LA\");\n    c1 <++> c2;\n}"

## IMPORTANT REMINDERS

✓ Jac is NOT Python - use semicolons and braces
✓ Type annotations required: has name: str (not has name)
✓ Global variables: glob var: type = value;
✓ Access globals with :g:varname
✓ Entry points: with entry { code; }
✓ Objects: obj ClassName { has attr: type; }
✓ Nodes: node NodeName { has attr: type; }
✓ Walkers: walker WalkerName { has attr: type; }
✓ Edges: edge EdgeName { has prop: type; }
✓ Connections: node1 ++> node2 (forward), <++> (bidirectional)
✓ Visit: visit [-->] (outgoing), [<--] (incoming)
✓ Abilities: can ability_name with entry { code; }
✓ References: self (instance), here (current location), visitor (visiting walker)

## BEFORE SUBMITTING

Double-check that:
[ ] Your response is valid JSON
[ ] All test IDs from test_prompts.json are included
[ ] Code uses Jac syntax (semicolons, braces, type annotations)
[ ] Required elements from hints are present
[ ] Code strings are properly escaped

## NOW RESPOND

Provide your JSON response with Jac code for all test cases below:
